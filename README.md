# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (offered by deeplearning.ai)

Programming assignments and quizzes from all courses in the Coursera [Deep Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by `deeplearning.ai`.

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Notes

### For detailed interview-ready notes on all courses in the Coursera Deep Learning specialization, refer [www.aman.ai](https://aman.ai/).

## Setup

Run ```setup.sh``` to (i) download a pre-trained VGG-19 dataset and (ii) extract the zip'd pre-trained models and datasets that are needed for all the assignments.

## Credits

This repo contains my work for this specialization. The code base, quiz questions and diagrams are taken from the [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), unless specified otherwise.

## 2021 Version

This specialization was updated in April 2021 to include developments in deep learning and programming frameworks, with the biggest change being shifting from TensorFlow 1 to TensorFlow 2. This repo has been updated accordingly as well.

## Disclaimer

I recognize the time people spend on building intuition, understanding new concepts and debugging assignments. The solutions uploaded here are **only for reference**. They are meant to unblock you if you get stuck somewhere. Please do not copy any part of the code as-is (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully). This course is the most straight-forward deep learning course I have ever taken, with fabulous course content and structure. It's a treasure by the deeplearning.ai team.
